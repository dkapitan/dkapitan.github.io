<p><strong>Hi, Sami. Thank you for sharing your career story with Real World Data Science. Please tell us a little about yourself and your role in data science.</strong><br>
Hello! I’m Sami Rahman, a passionate head of data engineering and data platform at Penguin Random House, the book publisher that has enriched lives through literature. I started my career in data science five years ago and I’ve evolved into a data generalist with expertise in machine learning, data infrastructure, and data strategy.</p>
<p><strong>What does your job involve?</strong><br>
My role is about harnessing the power of data to drive extraordinary outcomes. Leading a skilled team, we empower our company to leverage data and cutting-edge technologies for informed decisions and automation. I help shape our organisation’s capabilities in data science, analytics, machine learning, data management, and strategy.</p>
<p><strong>What does “data science” mean to you?</strong><br>
Data science, to me, is a captivating fusion of modern data technologies and computational statistics that tackles business challenges, crafts intelligent automation, and generates insightful revelations.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think is your most important skill as a data scientist?</strong><br>
Active listening is key. A data scientist must be surgical and precise in developing models, analysis, and tools that reinforce the company’s bottom line and operations. Data science exists to create value using data.</p>

<p>As I’ve transitioned into management, maintaining my coding prowess is an ongoing challenge. I stay sharp by doing data science and infrastructure development for fun, leveraging tools like ChatGPT and AirOps where I’m rusty.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>How did you get into data science?</strong><br>
I began with a psychology degree, which led to working as business psychologist where I discovered psychometric data analysis. After a master’s in countering organised crime and terrorism and a few short jobs in counter terrorism/intelligence, I decided that it wasn’t for me. I embraced my love for statistics and research, I dove into data science, learning Python through online platforms, and secured my first data scientist role at a WPP agency called Essence.</p>
<p><strong>What, or who, first inspired you to become a data scientist?</strong><br>
I always thought someone like me couldn’t work in data, let alone data science. <a href="https://www.wbs.ac.uk/about/person/suzy-moat/">Dr Suzy Moat’s</a> fascinating talk on machine learning’s application to human behaviour and psychology showed me that a psychologist could make a significant impact in this field, inspiring my aspiration to try to have a data science career.</p>
<p><strong>What were the hurdles or challenges that you needed to overcome on your route into the profession?</strong><br>
Breaking into data science without a typical background in maths/computer science/physics was daunting. Building a Kaggle portfolio and coding models for fun prepared me for interviews. Another challenge was learning to harmonise my “data brain” and “business brain” to solve problems efficiently. Understanding how data solutions impact business problems will always propel you forward. </p>
<p><strong>And what are the challenges that you face now, as a working data scientist?</strong><br>
As I’ve transitioned into management, maintaining my coding prowess is an ongoing challenge. I stay sharp by doing data science and infrastructure development for fun, leveraging tools like ChatGPT and AirOps where I’m rusty. I’m currently building my own cloud data platform and running a lot of image neural networks on it.</p>
<p><strong>What was your first job in data science, and how does it compare to your current role?</strong><br>
As an analytics executive at WPP agency Essence, I tackled data science, cloud engineering, and analytics problems for clients. They were a lot more singular and tactical in nature. Now, as head of data engineering and data platform at Penguin Random House, I focus on shaping data and technology strategy to align with the company’s broader vision.</p>
<p><strong>What was the most important thing you learned in your first year on the job?</strong><br>
To always consider the bigger picture: how your work integrates with the organisation/client’s objectives, delivers value, and aligns with the aspirations of other stakeholders. Actionable insights and value is the most important thing.</p>
<p><strong>What have been your career highlights so far?</strong><br>
Two shining moments include being the first of three of HSBC UK fraud data science leaders, where each of our departments tackled a different type of crime and protected our customers, and developing data strategies and capabilities for analytics, science, and business intelligence at Penguin Random House.</p>
<p><strong>Have there been any mistakes or regrets along the way?</strong><br>
I regret not delving deeper into natural language processing (NLP) or spatial data science, which are now more accessible and growing fields within data science. I reckon the NLP methodologies would’ve been extremely useful seeing as I’m at a publishing company now!</p>
<p><strong>How do you think your role will evolve over the rest of your career?</strong><br>
As data technologies become more accessible, I anticipate data roles will transform. I envision a future where data professionals focus on general AI, quantum machine learning, and multi-dimensional data analytics as traditional specialisms become democratised.</p>
<p><strong>If you were starting out in data science now, what three things would you put at the top of your reading/study list?</strong><br>
I’d recommend <em>Skin in the Game</em> by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, <em>Calling Bullshit: The Art of Scepticism in a Data-Driven World</em> by Jevin West and Carl Bergstrom,  and <em>Artificial Intelligence: How Machine Learning Will Shape the Next Decade</em> by Matthew Burgess.</p>
<p><strong>What personal or professional advice would you give for anyone wanting to be a data scientist now?</strong><br>
Success in data science hinges on understanding how it can transform organisations and engaging with business stakeholders. My advice: never stop listening to the business – the stakeholders are your biggest allies. I would also try to find your niche that sets you apart from everyone else. Mine when I first started in the field was my expertise on computational psychology and behavioural machine learning. </p>
<p><strong>What new ideas or developments in the field of data science are you personally most excited about or intrigued by?</strong><br>
Transfer learning excites me most, as numerous large technology companies now offer pre-trained models based on billions/trillions of parameters. This will revolutionise industries worldwide, as it will be easier to build more performant models even if a company has less data.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think will be the main challenges facing data science as a field in the next few years?</strong><br>
The challenge lies in staying relevant amidst the democratisation of data science. Through large language models, low-code, and transfer learning, advanced data science methods will become easier for non-specialists to do and use. Innovation and keeping up with modern data technologies will be crucial.</p>

  <title>The politics of performance measurement</title>
  <dc:creator>Noah Wright</dc:creator>
  <link>https://realworlddatascience.net/careers/posts/2023/04/18/politics-of-performance-measurement.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>At the beginning of 2016, the Criminal Justice Division (CJD) of the Texas Governor’s Office received news all government agencies dread: budgets were to be cut. CJD oversaw a grant program that funded specialty courts throughout the state, however it was now being told that the program’s budget of $10.6m would be reduced 20% to $8.5m by 2018.</p>
<p>How should these cuts be distributed among grant holders? CJD had no meaningful performance data on which to base its decisions, and I would know: I was hired by the agency just a few months before to analyze grant performance. Still, decisions needed to be made. We had to come up with a plan of action, and the clock was ticking…</p>
<p>This is a story of making opportunity out of crisis, of the interaction between not just theory of change and technical implementation, but the “political” process of negotiating these changes with stakeholders in a manner that led to better decisions. Through careful outreach and continuous communication, we developed a data collection and performance assessment process that enabled us to allocate budget cuts in a manner widely accepted.</p>
<p>The story ends on a bittersweet note. But, along the way, there are lessons to be learned about how to find common ground, manage expectations, forge productive working partnerships, and sustain a data science project longer term.</p>

<section id="step-1-consider-your-options" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-1-consider-your-options">Step 1: Consider your options</h2>
<p>Texas had over 150 specialty courts in 2016, providing a program of specialized services – usually drug treatment – to offenders as an alternative to incarceration. About half of the state’s specialty courts received CJD grant funds (and about half of grantees received 100% of their program budget from our grants). Funding cuts of the size we needed to make would not go over well with them. Any changes to the program would have to run a gauntlet of decision-makers including advisory boards, interest groups, and professional associations, most with contacts in the legislature.</p>
<p>Complicating this situation further, CJD didn’t even make the final funding decisions. We administered the grants, but the merit review process fell to the Specialty Courts Advisory Council, an appointed group of specialty courts staff and related experts who annually scored the grant applications we received. We needed to get them onboard.</p>
<p>The way our Executive Director saw it, we had three options to implement the cut in a way that could get us buy-in from stakeholders and the Advisory Council:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Cut across the board.</strong> The Advisory Council would employ the same scoring method as the previous year but reduce each grant amount by 20%.</li>
</ol>
<p>This option would leave long-running grantees scrambling to make up for this shortfall by reducing services, laying off staff, or spending more of their limited local funds. Worse, it would punish all grantees equally – our most successful programs would be arbitrarily defunded.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><strong>Fewer grants.</strong> Grants were scored based on the quality of their application and all grants that passed a certain threshold got funded. The Advisory Council would employ the same scoring method as the previous year but instead of funding the top $10.6m worth of grants, they would fund the top $8.5m worth.</li>
</ol>
<p>This seemed a less bad option than cutting across the board, but we would still run into the problem of arbitrarily defunding successful programs. Grants near the bottom of the Advisory Council’s cutoff that got funded the previous year would be denied renewal only because the goalposts had moved.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><strong>Targeted funding.</strong> The Advisory Council would incorporate performance data and statewide strategic plan alignment into their scoring method and make cuts accordingly.</li>
</ol>
<p>At the time, the Advisory Council did not take performance into consideration when scoring grant applications. They agreed in theory that a grant requesting its tenth annual renewal should perhaps at some point be assessed on its outcomes, but they had never seen CJD commit to a rigorous performance assessment process before. We administered the grants, not them, so without our commitment to develop a performance assessment process, and their trust in that commitment, this would not be a viable option.</p>
<p>After due consideration, option 3 emerged as the favorite of our Executive Director. On the face of it, this seemed the most “objective” approach to take. We would let the data decide who gets funded and who doesn’t, rather than cutting arbitrarily. But that would be a fallacious argument. Data does not decide. It might inform our decisions, but it would be up to us to choose the structure of the performance measurement process: what aspects to focus on, what data to collect, what benchmarks to set – all of which would later help determine funding decisions. And in any funding decision, politics inevitably plays a role.</p>
<p>Politics is, in its broadest sense, the negotiated decision-making between groups with opposing interests. And in developing our performance measurement process we would encounter a variety of interests – from the Advisory Council down to the grantees themselves. Success would require us to acknowledge stakeholder perspectives and address or manage them appropriately. Planning decisions made in the early phases of a project as a result of political processes directly influence the type and scope of analysis a data scientist will eventually be able to perform, so it behooves the data scientist to participate in these processes!</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-2-engage-stakeholders-and-define-performance">Step 2: Engage stakeholders and define performance</h2>
<p>Having settled on our preferred option, our Executive Director convened a strategy session with the Advisory Council to discuss how to proceed as part of a broader strategic plan. The session began by achieving consensus on high-level goals such as “fund strategically”, “focus on success”, “build capacity”, etc. The session also helped the Advisory Council and CJD alike to clarify our conception of how we ought to fit into the specialty courts field going forward. CJD would develop its performance assessment system to help the Advisory Council target funding, but that would come as part of a larger plan that included capacity building, training and technical assistance, helping courts obtain non-CJD sources of funding, and steering grantees toward established best practice.</p>
<p>We left the meeting with a very basic plan that looked good on paper. Our Executive Director set to work persuading our external stakeholders of the wisdom of this new strategic direction. Meanwhile, I had to build a performance assessment process that people could trust.</p>
<p>CJD had no formally designated standards to measure performance data against. However, drug courts have been around for decades and there existed a large body of research supporting the program model.<sup>1</sup> Offering supervised drug treatment instead of incarceration had been repeatedly shown to cost less money and lower recidivism rates. I performed a literature review and spoke with numerous subject matter experts to get started on defining program-specific performance metrics.</p>
<p>I was conscious that imposing metrics without any feedback or input from affected parties would all but guarantee bad-faith engagement, especially if these metrics are tied to funding. A problem inherent to any performance measurement is that once something gets measured as a performance outcome, it warps the very processes it is intended to measure. This phenomenon happens so frequently that the phrase “Campbell’s Law” was coined to describe it in 1979.<sup>2</sup> Think of standardized testing at schools: once the government ties test performance to school funding it creates powerful incentives for schools to improve test scores at any cost. Even in the absence of outright cheating, struggling schools feel massive pressure to adjust their curriculum, to the point where they teach test score optimization strategies more than math, language, history, and science.</p>
<p>I consistently heard from specialty court scholars and practitioners alike that arrest recidivism would be the ideal outcome measure. On paper, recidivism was a direct expression of long-term program success and could also be used as an outcome variable for classification modeling. And, in practice, a court could do little to affect recidivism by way of manipulation. Courts do not make arrests – police make arrests. Once a specialty court participant finished a program, the court itself no longer intervened in their lives. If a participant got arrested within 1-3 years of completion, the program had no say in the matter.</p>
<p>This, however, presented an implementation problem: one-year recidivism data would, by definition, take a year past the point of implementation to collect, i.e., not soon enough to inform our cuts. And while recidivism was the best measure of success, it could not be the only measure. Recidivism was, after all, a stochastic process not within the court’s control – a crime wave or other systemic factors could move recidivism up and make it look like a successful court had actually failed. We would have to use something else as well.</p>
<p>The National Association of Drug Court Professionals (NADCP) publishes a book of best practice standards, and our stakeholders identified a court’s adherence to these standards as another strong performance assessment standard. These criteria, unlike recidivism, were directly under the program’s control. Does your program have the recommended staff? Does your program drug test participants frequently enough to guarantee sobriety? Does your program meet with participants regularly enough? Do you offer a continuum of services instead of a “one-size-fits-all” approach?</p>
<p>In addition to being much easier to measure than recidivism, best practice adherence also resists Campbell’s Law by avoiding outcome measurement. In our school metaphor, this would be like measuring school performance based on student-to-teacher ratio, variety of course offerings, attendance rates, and teacher qualifications. Far from perfect, but measuring a variety of elements that predict success and taking them as a whole represents a vast improvement over a single, easily-gamed outcome measure.</p>
<p>But to operationalize these standards, we would have to have good data.</p>
</section>
<section id="step-3-update-processes-and-collect-data" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-3-update-processes-and-collect-data">Step 3: Update processes and collect data</h2>
<p>We inherited a longstanding process in which grantees had to fill out a form every six months asking them to report performance data. This is a screenshot of what that form looked like:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://realworlddatascience.net/careers/posts/2023/04/18/images/screenshot.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="A screenshot of a data table containing example data collected from grantees in the Texas speciality courts funding program, prior to the development of a new performance measurement process."></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>No additional definitions or instructions were provided, leaving grantees with many questions: Does the request for “annual data” mean as of fiscal year or calendar year? What counts as a person being “assessed for eligibility”? And so on. Grantees did not know the answers, and neither did we. And these were the more straightforward measures. The form went on for 10 pages, most of which asked grantees to report extensively on information they had already provided as part their application.</p>
<p>This disaster of an assessment process did have a silver lining. When we announced we were throwing out these forms entirely we faced almost no pushback from grantees.</p>
<p>We knew from the start that our new assessment process would need to collect individual-level participant data instead of aggregated measures. Even with clear definitions, 75 grants would mean 75 different aggregations at work. Asking the grantees to report their individual-level participant data in a consistent format and doing the aggregations ourselves meant a single aggregation at work.</p>
<p>But we needed to establish trust with grantees before making this request. Strictly speaking, we could mandate the reporting of this data. However, if that angered enough of our grantees, they or their contacts might take it up with our bosses at the Governor’s Office, and our bosses could cancel any plan we came up with if they thought it was not worth the fuss. So, from day one we communicated clearly to all grantees that we would maintain total transparency when it came to definitions and calculations. Before we used any calculated metric to assess performance we would send it to the grantees themselves to review for accuracy.</p>
<p>To avoid the vagueness and inscrutability that characterized the old reporting process, every piece of data we asked for in the new process had a clear written definition and specific reason for being asked. These reasons usually amounted to some combination of best practices, Advisory Council recommendations, and grantee suggestions.</p>
<p>Implementing the new process was far from easy, however. We faced numerous administrative and technical barriers. Texas courts at this time did not share a common case management system, so we couldn’t just get a data export from everybody. Meanwhile, the Governor’s Office banned all of its divisions from all usage of the cloud. This forced us to build a more labor-intensive reporting process, in which courts would obtain blank Excel templates with required data fields. Courts had either to fill out these templates by hand or export their case management data and reconfigure it to template specifications. Then, courts submitted their data for review and we sent back any bad formatting.</p>
<p>We collected preliminary data at the six-month mark and made another adjustment based on these results, which we would not count toward performance measurement. A majority of courts had some kind of data error in this first case. Specific definitions of data fields had to be written and rewritten using grantee feedback over the course of the year, leading to significant changes between the six-month reports and the year-end reports.</p>
<p>Importantly, we had developed reporting requirements iteratively with participation from grantees and the Advisory Council from the start. By mid-2017 we had so successfully achieved buy-in that only one grantee court’s judge refused to give us data (the court’s grant manager later sent it to us).</p>

<p>In the course of this process, we established the benchmarks in Table 1 based on best practices and justification for funding. Because this was our initial rollout, we set the specific values low to function more as minimum standards than targets.</p>

<p>Grantee performance data for each benchmark would be generated from the individual level data that courts sent us.

If something didn’t look right, they had the chance to let us know before we took their numbers as final.</p>

<p>In the end, we found seven grants that we could unequivocally recommend be cut. Two of the seven had effectively never gotten off the ground, and served almost no participants the entire year. The other five served mostly low-risk participants, the type of people that research had shown do not benefit from specialty court programs. Some of these grantees were inevitably disappointed at the decision, but we had so actively worked within the field to develop and justify our processes that they understood why the decision had been made.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="factors-for-success">Factors for success</h2>
<p>In the span of one year, CJD went from collecting a large volume of useless data to a specific, targeted collection of data informed by best practices. The new collection process had high grantee compliance and stakeholder buy-in.</p>
<p>The following factors proved essential to getting to a place where we had useful, reliable data upon which to base future data science efforts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><dl>
<dt>Discontent with status quo</dt>
<dd>
<p>The Advisory Council wanted CJD to play a more active support role in the field. Meanwhile, everyone disliked the existing performance assessment process. As a result, most of the challenges we faced along the way related to implementation rather than defending the status quo on its merits.</p>
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl>
<dt>A catalyst for change</dt>
<dd>
<p>Despite existing discontent, it took a funding shortfall to kickstart the process of change. It would have been unlikely for us to be able to create this system <em>a priori</em>.</p>
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl>
<dt>Continuous, high-quality communication</dt>
<dd>
<p>We could impose rules and requirements all day long, but without good faith engagement from the grantees we could never collect the quality of data we needed. Note that “continuous communication” does not mean “tell them everything you do at every point”. People become overwhelmed by torrents of information.</p>
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl>
<dt>Humility and flexibility</dt>
<dd>
<p>Had we begun this process assuming we had all of the answers, we would have been dead in the water. Continuous outreach and willingness to take criticism and suggestions shaped the process as it progressed, ultimately producing a better end-product than we could have devised on our own.</p>
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl>
<dt>An established program model</dt>
<dd>
<p>Drug courts have been around for decades, with a vast body of supporting research and a community of practitioners and scholars we could speak to. That meant we could focus on implementation and execution instead of determining if the model worked or not.</p>
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl>
<dt>Strong leadership support</dt>
<dd>
<p>From the very beginning, we could not have accomplished what we did without the full support and advocacy of our Executive Director.</p>
</dd>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="coda-why-knowledge-transfer-is-vital">Coda: Why knowledge transfer is vital</h2>
<p>I wish I could write a follow-up article about how we started using classification modeling to identify the most successful programs and to promote better approaches and practices; about how we iterated the process through multiple funding cycles, tuning and perfecting it to better meet stakeholder needs. But I cannot.</p>
<p>The performance assessment system we built had some major weaknesses from the outset. It was labor intensive, not required by law, produced no immediate benefit to the agency itself, and was so new it had yet to be entrenched in agency practice. In other words, no institutional incentives worked in its favor. Only the continual push of our Executive Director and myself kept this new performance assessment system going, and once we left the agency, it foundered.</p>
<p>Still, the experience taught me much. I learned first and foremost that programs do not sustain themselves. Most of our attention had been focused on building up the best process we could. Only a minimal effort had been spent on institutionalizing and sustaining it. We had written documentation but no fundamental changes in policy or rule. We had undertaken groundbreaking efforts and built relationships, but had not planned for any meaningful knowledge transfer to other staff. While we had intended to eventually do these things, fate took us away before we could get them in place.</p>
<p>For any kind of change to last, sustainability must be built in from the start. In the moment, these actions can seem low-priority. Policy and rule changes can be arduous and time-consuming. Knowledge transfer from one stably employed staff to another feels redundant and wasteful. But without embedding sustainability, no success will outlast the individual people pushing for it.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><strong>Hi, Tamanna. Thank you for sharing your career story with Real World Data Science. Please tell us a little about yourself and your role in data science.</strong><br>
I’m Tamanna Haque. I’ve been working at Jaguar Land Rover for nearly four years, recently promoted to lead data scientist working within product engineering. It’s coming up to eight years that I’ve been working in the field, and my areas of interest are the use of machine learning to provide the best products and experiences for my customers and stakeholders.</p>
<p><strong>What does your job involve?</strong><br>
My role involves using the connected car and AI to make our products and customer experiences better, whilst leading within our wide data science team too. The data science team in Manchester, UK, originated with myself and one of my teammates – it’s since grown to nearly 40 (cross-sites and countries) and developed into a high-performing, advanced data science team.</p>
<p>What makes us stand out is the nature of our work – we mostly use vehicle data (of participating customers), which is different to a lot of other commercial businesses or teams who’ll focus more on transactional or web data. The data we use lends itself to some pretty interesting projects, and a general futuristic feel here.</p>
<p>I’m particularly interested and active in enabling a more electric and modern luxury future from the use of vehicle data.</p>
<p><strong>What does “data science” mean to you?</strong><br>
The realisation of value! Whether that is added revenue, saved costs or improved growth, I’m led by what data science can do for the business and its customers. The use of data science can open up many exciting, value-adding opportunities.</p>

<p>There are more routes to getting into data science nowadays, but it’s important to not lose sight of fundamentals such as statistics and mathematics. A lot of people can code-up models but it’s fair to say that only a portion of them appreciate how to do this responsibly.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>What do you think is your most important skill as a data scientist?</strong><br>
I’ve always presented myself as a technically astute data scientist, even when entering leadership. But my niche is my ever-growing commercial awareness and passion about our products, customers and business. These aren’t new qualities, but they now align with my professional interests, as well as personal (I’ve been a fan of the Jaguar brand since childhood)!</p>
<p><strong>How did you get into data science?</strong><br>
I did a maths degree at the University of Manchester, where I specialised in statistics. I didn’t do any post-graduate education and this was fine for me.</p>
<p>After graduating, I joined a digital fashion retailer (with a financial services proposition) as an analyst initially. I learned a lot about real-life data and analytics itself, whilst developing a rounded understanding about the business and how to deal with stakeholders cross-functionally. I must have served a few hundred at least(!) and left most of the ‘fancy’ stuff I learned at university aside, whilst getting to grips with so many aspects of commercial analytics. A great way for me to set solid foundations for what followed, and I personally feel this gives me a lens that others who dive straight into data science don’t have.</p>
<p>I was soon attracted to data science because it tapped into what I learned at university and challenges you to keep learning; there’ll always be things to learn, and new advances in the field.</p>
<p><strong>What, or who, first inspired you to become a data scientist?</strong><br>
I have a twin sister, we’ve always been together throughout education. Even before we graduated together, she secured her first role as an analyst. This opened my eyes to data, and data science followed for us both!</p>
<p><strong>What were the hurdles or challenges that you needed to overcome on your route into the profession?</strong><br>
I had a few people tell me I couldn’t do data science, possibly because I didn’t fit the typical data scientist stereotype in several ways. I think attitudes in the field have changed over time though and on a personal level, it’s motivated me to give it everything, and I can’t regret that.</p>
<p><strong>And what are the challenges that you face now, as a working data scientist?</strong><br>
I need to manage my diary well to ensure effectiveness and work-life balance. I’m overseeing people, other projects, doing public speaking and trying to remain hands on. I sometimes block out chunks of time in my diary – I need some meeting-free time to produce quality technical work. I try to finish on time and enjoy a very busy social life with my family and friends. A flexible attitude to how we work helps to keep me happy and energised whilst I’m delivering from various angles.</p>
<p><strong>Thinking back to your earlier roles in data science, how do they compare to your current role?</strong><br>
My current role is very different to my previous roles. I’m continually learning and adapting how I can be a good leader, providing support to a breadth of colleagues (in and outside the team) whilst delivering myself. I’m actively involved in setting and refining our team’s strategy and I’m enjoying leading projects which either deliver high financial impact or help set the path in terms of new tech and/or machine learning capability. There is much more responsibility but it’s easy to stay energised when working on cars and for a business I’ve long admired.</p>
<p><strong>What was the most important thing you learned in your first year on the job?</strong><br>
I should have had more confidence in myself, but this grew – as I adjusted to the new environment I became much more assertive. My domain knowledge and data science expertise combined help to build my self-confidence, credibility and reputation.</p>
<p><strong>What have been your career highlights so far?</strong><br>
I’m most proud of my recent promotion from senior to lead data scientist. Also it was exciting for my family and I when I gained an offer to join Jaguar Land Rover.</p>
<p><strong>Have there been any mistakes or regrets along the way?</strong><br>
No, what’s meant to be will be!</p>
<p><strong>How do you think your role will evolve over the rest of your career?</strong><br>
My progression has been relatively rapid, and I hope I’ve got many, many years ahead of me in my career. It’s hard to say how my role will evolve, I have a blend of responsibilities in my role which combined provide great fulfilment for me at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>If you were starting out in data science now, what would you put at the top of your reading/study list?</strong><br>
A good understanding of analytics and the domain you’re in are my recommended prerequisites to doing data science.</p>
<p>Analytics is an important part of the data science lifecycle, being able to get the data yourself and communicate results with influence, for example, are just a few aspects of analytics which underpin successful data science projects.</p>
<p>Also, without awareness of the business and industry you’re working in, you can become very dependent on others. Data science itself can be quite challenging, so it’s great to have a solid foundation before starting out.</p>
<p><strong>What personal or professional advice would you give for anyone wanting to be a data scientist now?</strong><br>
With the level of continuous learning required to just simply keep up, it can be more of a lifestyle and not a job, so this is something to consider!</p>
<p><strong>What do you think will be the main challenges facing data science as a field in the next few years?</strong><br>
I still expect to see a skills gap in the field. There are more routes to getting into data science nowadays, but it’s important to not lose sight of fundamentals such as statistics and mathematics. A lot of people can code-up models but it’s fair to say that only a portion of them appreciate how to do this responsibly, understanding samples versus populations, statistical testing, which type of regularisation to use in a neural network, et cetera.</p>
<p>I also think there’s a challenge of questionable data science products reaching high levels of popularity and usage amongst the public… Some recent developments in this space have been extremely intelligent but raise ethical concerns. Just because something can be done with AI doesn’t mean it should, and my preferences are towards AI being ethical and (ideally) explainable.</p>
