[Zan Armstrong’s comet chart](https://www.zanarmstrong.com/#/infovisresearch/) has been on my list of hobby projects for a while now. I think it is an elegant solution to visualize statistical mix effects and address Simpson’s paradox, and particularly useful when working with longitudinal data involving different sub-populations. Recently I found a good excuse to spend some time to actually use it as part of a exploratory data analysis on a project.

Since I mostly work in Python and have recently fallen in love with [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/index.html) — for the same reasons as [Fernando explains here](http://fernandoi.cl/blog/posts/altair/) — I wondered how the comet chart could be implemented using the [grammar of interactive graphics](https://idl.cs.washington.edu/papers/vega-lite/). It took me a while to figure out how to actually plot the comets. In a previous version, I had [drawn glyphs using Bokeh](https://github.com/dkapitan/comet-chart/blob/master/comet-chart.ipynb). While Altair allows you to plot any SVG path in a graph, this felt a bit hacky and not quite in line with the philosophy of using a grammar of graphics.

Thankfully [Mattijn was quick to suggest using trail-marks](https://github.com/altair-viz/altair/issues/2395#issuecomment-766454328), after which it was almost as easy as pie. So here’s an example using a dataset of 20,000 flights for 59 destination airports.

```{python}
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd
import vega_datasets


# Use airline data to assess statistical mix effects of delays
flights = vega_datasets.data.flights_20k()
aggregation = dict(
    number_of_flights=("destination", "count"),
    mean_delay=("delay", "mean"),
    mean_distance=("distance", "mean"),
)

# Compare delays by destination between month 1 and 3
grouped = flights.groupby(by=[flights.destination, flights.date.dt.month])
df = (
    grouped.agg(**aggregation)
    .loc[(slice(None), [1, 3]), :]
    .assign(
        change_mean_delay=lambda df:
            df.groupby("destination")["mean_delay"].diff(),
    )
    .fillna(method="bfill")
    .reset_index()
    .round(2)
)

# Calculate weigthed average of delays for month 1 and 3
total = (
    flights.groupby(flights.date.dt.month)
    .agg(**aggregation)
    .loc[[1, 3], :]
    .assign(
        change_mean_delay=lambda df: df.mean_delay.diff(),
        destination='TOTAL'
    )
    .fillna(method="bfill")
    .round(2)
    .reset_index()
    .loc[:, df.columns]
)


def comet_chart(df, stroke="white"):
    return (
    alt.Chart(df, width=600, height=450)
    .mark_trail(stroke=stroke)
    .encode(
        x=alt.X("number_of_flights", scale=alt.Scale(type="log")),
        y=alt.Y("mean_delay"),
        detail="destination",
        size=alt.Size("date", scale=alt.Scale(range=[0, 10]), legend=None),
        tooltip=[
            "destination",
            "number_of_flights",
            "mean_delay",
            "change_mean_delay",
            "mean_distance",
        ],
        # trails don't support continuous color
        # see https://github.com/vega/vega/issues/1187
        # hence use bins
        color=alt.Color(
            "change_mean_delay:Q",
            bin=alt.Bin(step=2),
            scale=alt.Scale(scheme="blueorange"),
            legend=alt.Legend(orient="top"),
        ),
    )
)


comet_chart(df) + comet_chart(total, stroke="black")
```

In the example shown here, each comet represents one destination airport. The head of the comet corresponds to the most recent observation of the number of flight arrivals (x-axis, shown as logarithmic scale to accommodate the wide range of observations) against the mean delay of those flights (y-axis). The tail of the comet represents a similar (x,y) datum, but from an earlier point in time. Finally, the colour of the comet is encoded to show the change in the mean delay for each airport. A tooltip with a summary of the data is shown when hovering over the head of the comet.

So-called mix effects can often lead to misinterpretation of aggregate numbers. In the example of flight delays, the fact that only a small change is observed in the mean delay across all airports — visualized with the right-most comet outlined in black — hides the underlying variance between airports. Note that in this example the size of each sub-population (number of flights per airport) remains relatively constant, hence the comets here only go up and down. As explained in [the original article](https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/42901.pdf), mix effects become harder to interpret when the relative size of the sub-populations change as well as their relative values. In the most extreme case this may lead to [Simpson’s paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox).

With this base implementation of comet charts in Altair, you can really go to town and combine it with other interactive graphs. Using the [overview-detail](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/scatter_with_layered_histogram.html) pattern, you could plot an accompanying density plot of all the flights for a given airport. That way you can quickly zoom in to the lowest level of detail and get a better understanding of the underlying mix effects.
