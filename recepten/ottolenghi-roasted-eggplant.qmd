## Ingredienten

- 4 medium eggplants (sliced into 3/4-inch rounds (2 lb 2 oz))
- Salt
- 7 tablespoons olive oil
- 6 anchovy fillets in oil (drained and finely chopped (about 1 tablespoon))
- 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
- 1 small garlic clove (crushed)
- Black pepper
- 1 tablespoon oregano leaves
- 1/4 cup parsley leaves (roughly chopped)

## Bereidingswijze

1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
1. Mix eggplant in a large bowl with 1/2 teaspoon salt. Transfer to 2 large parchment-lined baking sheets and then brush with 5 tablespoons of oil — you want it on both sides of the discs. Bake for 35 minutes, until dark golden brown and cooked through. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.
1. In a small bowl, whisk together the anchovies, vinegar, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper. Slowly pour in the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil, whisking continuously, until combined.
1. When ready to serve, finely chop the oregano and place in a large bowl along with the eggplant and parsley. Pour in the anchovy dressing, gently mix, and transfer to a platter or bowl.
